# TheRoyalGameofUr

This is the ancient reciently discovered game called the Royal Game of Ur.

This was my small attempt of playing around with Unity Engine. The game is not perfect but it is passable.

Side note: I may revisit this but at this point I really dont think I am anywhere close to actual game dev
